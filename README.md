# rancher-export

A script to export `docker-compose` and `rancher-compose` configurations via the Rancher API v1. **NOTE** that only `v1` is supported at the moment, and **export** is the primary goal; import may be added later.

## configuration

create an `.env` file in this directory, following this format:

```
RANCHER_API_BASE_URL=https://the.rancher.url/v1
RANCHER_API_ACCESS_KEY=<your_key>
RANCHER_API_SECRET_KEY=<your_secret>
```

The keys are generated via Rancher UI -> API menu.

An "environment" key limits access to the Rancher environment you're currently signed in to. An "account" key gives access to all the environments you have access to.

## running

`node export.js`. The configs will be saved into an `export` directory in the current working dir.

the `export` directory must be manually removed before running this script again.

> NOTE any docker-compose projects created outside of Rancher on the host directly (e.g. via a continuous integration system) will be exported with empty docker-compose and rancher-compose files. Remove those directories.

## utilities

Prerequisite: `rancher-compose`. Download it from your Rancher instance.

WARNING: these tools are DANGEROUS and barely tested. Use at your own risk.

Create an `.env.import` file with the following format:

```
RANCHER_IMPORT_ENV_KEY=
RANCHER_IMPORT_ENV_SECRET=
RANCHER_IMPORT_URL=
```

These keys must be Rancher **"Environment"** keys (as opposed to "Account"). This file is kept separate from the `.env` file on purpose, for safety.

`./remove-affinity.sh <environment_name>` will remove the `io.rancher.scheduler.affinity:host_label:` keys from all `.yml` files in the target environment (directory). This is useful if the target hosts will not have the same labels as the source hosts.

`./import.sh <environment_name>` will import all stacks from a previously exported environment (under `export` in this directory) into the environment accessed by the above keys. It will name the stacks as per their directory names.
